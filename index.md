## Who am I 

I am a IT student on the Middle school in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm called Gymnázium a Střední průmyslová škola elektrotechniky a informatiky. Love creating things with the help of code and adore AI. When it comes to social life I am not afraid to go out with people that I just met.

I also do some sports here and there like running and cycling.

I am quite tall, have blonde hair, light blue eyes and round face. Wide shoulders,....but my looks do not matter.

I am 20 years old and live in Nový Jičín, Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic.

## Why I write open source code

At first I didn't think much of it, until I tried it. The beauty in writing open source code is that you get feedback from other, sometimes more experienced, people. Or you can work with them to create amazing projects. Some of my friends work on open source projects.

One of my favorite projects is [Object detection using Tensorflow](https://github.com/BeanGreen247/Object-detection-using-Tensorflow). It was a lot of fun to make.

## Tools I use

OS: Linux Mint

Kernel: 5.3.6-050306-generic

Code Editor/IDE: Graviton, Monodevelop

Markdown Editor: Typora
